			"text": "Boyfriend is a young, light-skinned man with spiky cyan hair and a confident expression. He wears a magenta-white T-shirt with a red prohibition sign, baggy dark blue pants, pink-red sneakers with magenta-white shoelaces and soles as well as black dots on the quarters, and a backward pink-red cap with a dark blue brim. He holds a bluish gray microphone in his right hand while keeping his left hand in his pocket. He is drawn in a chibi style, giving the impression that he is very small and/or disproportionate. His icons depict only his head in blue without a mouth, and the old one represents a simpler design, having a yellow-green color with light blue pupils and an open smile, while the unused version is a fusion of both, having a simple design, blue color, an expression that resembles Angry Faic and a backward red cap. The unused winning icon also has sunglasses"
